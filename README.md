## Hi, Friends! ðŸ‘‹ ##

I'm Olivia Morales, a Solutions Architect at CESMII - The Smart Manufacturing Institute.

CESMII is the United Statesâ€™ national institute for Smart Manufacturing. We are focused on driving cultural and technological transformation and secure industrial technologies as national imperatives. CESMII was created by the Federal government to help U.S. manufacturers of any size adopt smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 ideas.

Sharing technology and best practices will accelerate manufacturers' ability to solve complex problems. Defining standards and encouraging repeatability will keep those manufacturers from having to solve the same problems over and over.
